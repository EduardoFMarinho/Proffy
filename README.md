# Proffy
In this project, I'm developing a small system where students can hire private teachers. I'm currently using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The customer can login and filter the list of private teachers, and the same will be able to contact them. Teachers, on the other hand, can sign in write down their information regarding their private class.

# Getting Started

In order to open and edit this website, you need to have a Code Editor installed in your PC. Once that is done, download the file and open it in your editor. If you have Visual Code Studio, you can right click the file and select the "Open with Code" option.

# Features 

- User can sign in as a Teacher
- Teachers can write informations regarding their contact number, type of class/subject, personal bio, and how much they charge per hour. 
- Teachers will be listed in a page with a filter
- WhatsApp's API will be use for the contact number. Meaning that people can text you via WhatsApp right away just by clicking the contact button

# How to run


In order to run your project, you'll need Git Bash and Node JS. After that, follow the steps below:

$ npm install
$ npm run dev

You can access the project in http://localhost:5500 or in http://127.0.0.1:5500/
